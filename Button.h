/*	FIT2096 - Example Code
*	Button.h
*	Created by Elliott Wilson - 2015 - Monash University
*	This class represents a Button in our scene
*	It uses the sprite batch and a sprite font to render an image and the string on screen
*	It also supports a hover state image which is achieved via a texture that contains the
*	normal button texture on top and the hover state texture on the bottom (see Button.png for example)
